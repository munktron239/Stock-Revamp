# Ven's Stock Revamp

*This part pack replaces several of the stock textures and models, hopefully making them more beautiful in the process.*

## Features

- Most parts in the base game (i.e. not from Making History or any future expansions) get completely replaced, but there are a handful of exceptions:
	- Spaceplane parts are generally left alone.  (The "Wheesley", "Whiplash", and "Panther" engines get some decorative turbomachinery added to the front of them.)
	- Squad's revamped fuel tanks, adapters, and probe cores are still available as variants (though Ven's models are now the default variant for them).
	- Some of Squad's revamped thrusters and pods are left alone, since they have new functionality and look nice enough.
- New parts are added fill some gaps in the stock range, including half-sized deployable solar panels, structural girders in multiple sizes and configurations, and a range of Oscar 0.625m fuel tanks.

## Dependencies

Ven's Stock Revamp depends on [**Module Manager**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/50533-140-17x-module-manager-403-august-9th-2019-right-to-ludicrous-speed/&tab=comments#comment-720814), a compatible version of which is bundled in the zip file.

## FAQ (First Anticipated Question)

- Is this mod compatible with ReStock?
	- Not as-downloaded.  However, if you delete the PathPatches and Squad subfolders, you can keep the new parts that Ven made and let ReStock have its way with the stock parts.

## Download and install

	- A proper release!
	- Adapted to new models in 1.8 (new variants of Mk7 Nose cone and S3 fuel tanks, suppressed Squad's new service bay models).

	- Restored models and texture for short Rockomax decoupler and TR-8A radial decoupler.
- 1.14.2, 02019 11 16 "MoDeL DoEs NoT eXiSt"

		- RT-1 "Cricket", RT-2 "Grasshopper", and RockoMAX models (from Ven's new parts) are now also applied to the stock FM1 "Mite", F3S0 "Shrimp", and S2-33 "Clydesdale" respectively.  The RT-1, RT-2, and RockoMAX are now marked as 'TechHidden'.
		- Ven's Mk 5 Strip Light is also now 'TechHidden' because there's a better striplight (that actually emits light!) in the stock game.
	- Renamed "Part Bin" subfolder to "PartBin", to accommodate Module Manager patches
	- Localized SpaceX-style landing leg (missed this one back in VSR 1.10)
	- Fixed Nose Cone Mk7 patch.

	- Fixed bad interaction between KerBalloons patch and ReStock.
	- Fixed configuration errors in RealChute patch.
 - 1.17.0, 02026 05 05 "Monkey Business"

    - All part patches split into multiple files for ease of use
    - Various LOC fixes, mostly grammar
    - Added compatibility with OldPartsRevived, so all of Ven's models can appear in-game
    - Added :NEEDS[!Restock] to patches, so "technically" is now compatible with Restock
    	- Installing this fork alongside Restock won't give you any problems. It just won't replace any of the stock parts
    - Updated authors of parts that still had NovaSilisko instead of Ven
    - Removed: temporarly removed ModuleTestSubject from new parts - will eventually add them back
    - Deprecated parts now have updated descriptions
    - Explicit support for OldPartsRevived:
    	- If installed, some models that were previously unavailable will now be using Vens models
    	- Includes: the old Mk1-2 pod, the old decouplers/seperators, the old torodial tank, and more!
  
## Munktron's Notes
- I've tried my darndest to ensure compatibility in this web of mods: between Restock, OldPartsRevived, and VenStockRevamp
- In 99% of cases, there shouldn't be any issues with models battling it out over who gets to be displayed
	- If Restock is installed, those models will take priority. Some deprecated parts will also be replaced by Restock. A few of Ven's models will make it through, though
	- If OldPartsRevived is installed, a whitelist/blacklist will be provided and all of Ven's models will be available to be used (given that Restock isn't present)
- As for version compatibly: Everything from KSP 1.3 and up should work, as 1.4 was when parts started to get replaced

## Roadmap

One of these days, I'd like to make a white alternate texture for Ven's strut and fuel duct (like stock), but so far I haven't made anything that looks good.

## Credits

The vast majority of the models are by Ven.  EmbersArc/Enceos fixed up the revamped rover wheels, and some configuration fixes were supplied by notquitehalf.  The majority of the configuration fixes were committed by yours truly.

And of course, thanks are owed to Squad for making part models that are worth revamping.  :wink:
